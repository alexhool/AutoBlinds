# AutoBlinds
### ECE 4180 - Embedded Systems Project

---

## Project Overview

This project automates the opening and closing of roller blinds operated by a beaded chain, enhancing user convenience
and accessibility. The system can be retrofitted to most existing chain operated blinds. It utilizes an ESP32-C6
microcontroller to control a DC motor to open, close, or move the blinds to specific positions. Users can interact with
the system through several methods: **tactile switches** for manual operation, **time-of-flight (ToF) sensor** for
proximity control, and a **web interface** for remote activation and configuring daily activation schedules. The system
operates using a finite state machine with several distinct modes:

* **Toggle Mode:** Default operation mode where pressing the Open/Close buttons or proximity detection via the ToF
sensor move the blinds to their configured positions.

* **Manual Mode:** Activated by a pressing the Mode button, allows for precise position control by holding the
Open/Close buttons. The system automatically returns to Toggle Mode after a set timeout.

* **Configuration Mode:** Activated by holding the Mode button, allows the user to set the fully open and closed
position limits into non-volatile memory by holding the Open/Close buttons. The system automatically returns to Toggle
Mode after a set timeout.

## System Components

* **Microcontroller (ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1):** The central processing unit, executing the main control loop and
state machine logic. It manages peripherals via GPIO and I2C, handles networking tasks (Wi-Fi connection, Network Time
Protocol (NTP) synchronization, web interface), reads the encoder with its internal Pulse Counter (PCNT) module, and
controls the motor driver.

* **DC Motor w/ Encoder (JGY-370-EN):** A 158:1 geared DC motor that drives the physical movement of the blinds via the
beaded chain. Its integrated quadrature encoder provides rotational feedback for precise position tracking.
    + **3D-Printed Sprocket:** Mechanically couples the motor shaft to the beaded chain with the correct pitch and
        diameter. Model files available in `assets/`.<br/><br/>

* **Motor Driver (TB6612FNG):** An H-bridge to control the DC motor since the ESP32's GPIO pins cannot supply enough
current or voltage to directly power the motor. It receives PWM and direction signals from the ESP32, enabling forward,
reverse, speed control, and braking.

* **Time-of-Flight Sensor (VL53L0X):** An I2C sensor for proximity detection to enable touchless operation. It checks
if a user's hand gesture is within the range threshold, allowing the blinds to toggle between open/closed states or
interrupt current movement.

* **Timekeeping:** It uses the ESP32's internal timer for scheduled remote activation, allowing the blinds to open or
close automatically at user-defined times. Ihe timer periodically synchronized with an NTP server over Wi-FI to prevent
drift.

* **Web Interface:** An asynchronous web server for remote control and configuration over Wi-Fi. Users can open or
close their blinds and program the daily activation schedule without physical access to the device. The schedules are
saved to the ESP32's non-volatile memory.

* **Tactile Switches (x3):** Momentary buttons that provide the primary means for manual opening/closing, switching
between operational modes (Toggle, Manual, and Configuration), and setting the physical open/close limits during the
setup process.

* **RGB LED:** It provides visual status feedback to the user, indicating the system's current state (Setup, Idle,
Moving Open, Moving Close, Manual Mode, Config Open, Config Close, Config Save, and Error) and aiding in
troubleshooting.

* **Buck Converter:** It converts the 12V input supply voltage to 5V in order to power the ESP32 and peripherals.

## Problems Encountered

* **ESP32-C6 Compatibility:** Integrating the ESP32-C6 was challenging due to its novelty. A significant
portion of development time was dedicated to utilizing the encoder as the board has newer PCNT harware. This involved
creating a custom library (`ESP32PCNTEncoder`) by navigating technical documentation and using an existing Arduino
library as a baseline.

* **Position Accuracy:** Maintaining accurate encoder readings during rapid motor movements was challenging due to
motor coasting at the target position. Adjusting the motor driver outputs to enable braking resolved the drift.
Setting an appropriate position tolerance and saving the last known encoder position to memory helped prevent
inaccuracies even after a power loss.

* **State Machine Logic:** Ensuring clean transitions between system states required careful debugging. Initially, the
system occasionally skipped states upon button release. This was resolved by implementing boolean flags to correctly
handle button events during specific state transitions. Managing timeouts for different modes also added complexity.

* **Web Server & Persistence:** Implementing the web serverâ€™s scheduler, parsing HTML form data, and reliably saving
settings presented difficulties. Parsing the form required discovering the `sscanf()` function. During debugging, it
became clear that saving schedules was failing because the key names exceeded the maximum length allowed by the
Preferences library.

## Comparison to Real-World Systems

* **Target Application:** Unlike products such as SwitchBot Curtain, which are designed for rail-based curtains moving
horizontally, AutoBlinds specifically targets roller blinds operated by a vertical beaded chain.

* **Installation & Cost:** AutoBlinds is a cost-effective retrofit solution for existing beaded chain roller blinds,
whereas many commercial motorized blind systems require a complete replacement of the window covering.

* **Control Methods:** Unlike many commercial options that rely on proprietary RF protocols or cloud services,
AutoBlinds offers local network control via its web interface, enhancing user privacy and eliminating the need for app
downloads. It also supports a wider range of control inputs, improving accessibility and operational independence.

* **Power:** AutoBlinds requires a wired 12V power source, whereas most commercial solutions typically offer
battery-powered options.

## Potential Improvements

* **Motor Control:** Implement a PID control loop for smoother, more precise movement, and develop an automatic
calibration routine to detect blind position limits during initial setup.

* **Scheduling:** Implement per-day scheduling options and allow setting schedules based on sunrise and sunset times.

* **User Interface:** Develop a more sophisticated web interface with improved visual design, real-time status updates,
and graphical blind position feedback/control.

* **Security:** Enhance the security of the web interface with basic authentication and HTTPS encryption to prevent
unauthorized access.

* **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** Implement OTA firmware updates via Wi-Fi to eliminate the need for physical access
for reflashing.

* **Enclosure:** Create a 3D-printed enclosure and a custom PCB for the components for a smaller, aesthetically
pleasing package.

* **Power:** Design a version that can be powered by rechargeable batteries, with appropriate power management (sleep
modes, battery monitoring, and interrupts instead of polling).
